# Hotfix update - v1.0083 (May 12, 2020)

## This is kinda short cus I’m very busy but I needed to hotfix to prevent a hyperexponential bug that is currenting happening in game. These are the balances I’ve put in place

* If you have 1e1777 particles or MORE and you refresh, you will automatically reincarnate and then also revert to 1e1000 particles, 20 Tax+ Completions and 10 Multiplier/Accelerator-- completions. Also your particle tier producers will be reset (including price, don’t worry!) Sorry about that. This is necessary so that future content isn’t completely broken for you, i.e. you won’t be stuck in limbo for weeks or months while content catches up to you.
* Particle 1x3, 1x4 upgrades now cap when you get 1e1000 particles, for e6000 / e2000 bonuses respectively
* Tax challenge now gives a flat, multiplicative 2% tax evasion stat for each completion (So tax exponent is multiplied by 0.98^completions).
* Duplication rune changed from 10^(-Lvl/500) → 6^(-level/500) on tax reduction.
* Obtainium gain from challenges upgrade changed from 1 + C without a cap to 1 + 2C with a cap of 50x multiplier! This is a buff for everyone.
