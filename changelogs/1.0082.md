# V1.0082 Notes 
* The patch notes of gods and a big thank you for 111,111+ plays!

**IMPORTANT**: As always, before logging into a new patch, export your savefile and put it somewhere safe. You never know when your save might get corrupted due to a shift in updates. Sorry!

# Bug fixes
1. FINALLY fixed “The Singularity” after realizing that I made 2 errors, not one, in making the achievement work. Oops!
2. You know how buggy time is? I think I’ve made it a little less buggy by checking more often when to set a time point for your savefile.
3. I’ve hopefully removed any point for which offerings or obtainium can become “NaN” or negative, but as a failsafe if such an event were to occur, now it will autofix for you if you refresh. Unfortunately it sets the NaN value to 0, but better than having a permaglitched save! This should work on legacy errors as well. For people who had an overabundance due to a glitch, the new version will cut off any obtainium above 1.5 billion and offerings above 1 million, as these are likely the highest numbers one could legitimately get for each resource if they optimized for just a particular resource, over the lifespan of the game. This will ONLY HAPPEN ONCE, so don’t fret! If problems persist, don’t be afraid to contact Platonic on discord, he’ll be more than willing to help you out!
4. If you have negative offerings, obtainium, or resets for some weird reason the game will correct it to 0 when you login. This is for those still affected by this.
5. Fixed the [No shards] achievement descriptions repeating.
6. [Credit goes out to Khafra for this one] fixed a memory leak if a save was imported caused by an event listener being created multiple times.


# Balance Changes
1. Rune research will now affect Duplication Rune’s taxation reduction. This means you can evade potentially far more tax than you could before the update. Huzzah!
2. Increased the maximum obtainium needed to get 3.00x offering multiplier on reincarnation upgrade 3x5 from 100,000 to 30,000,000. The previous requirement didn’t remotely make sense since of how much easier it was to gain 100k obtainium than it is to gain 100k offerings.
3. I have capped crystal upgrade giving +0.1% per building per level to 120 levels, with a maximum effect of 12% per building purchased. The reason is that, right now, crystals are actually capable of growing hyperexponential with tax being the only limit. I don’t want the entire game progress revolving around increasing tax, so I’m cutting the crystal upgrades short. All capped upgrades will now give the maximum effect number on each one. Uncapped upgrades won’t say anything. I highly anticipate this to be a nerf to almost all end-game players, and I understand that, knowing that the previous effect should help mitigate it a little bit, and with the addition of content described below!



# QoL for nerds and number crunchers
1. Added a (1000x) purchase option for each tab that supports it! This is particularly helpful for runes, by the way. Try it!
2. All instances of kongregate score submission being in automatic functions has been removed. Instead, all stats can be submitted by a dedicated “Submit stats to Kongregate” button!
3. The need for putting the promo code inside of your import box is NO MORE! Now, introducing the promo code box along with the kongbox!

Find these in Settings!

4. Put in your code whenever you “Enter a promotion code here!” and it’ll tell you if it worked or not underneath the box. It’s about time this fan-favorite feature got its own spot in settings, amirite?
5. I finally made it so that the autobuyers for multipliers and accelerators are independent of the buyamount toggled in the tab!
6. Added a research toggleable option for buying either 1 level or buying MAX levels, or as many as affordable. Enjoy! [Note that this is a sort of lazy implementation as the preference is reset on each refresh. This will be fixed in v1.009 but at this point I was so tired I just wanted to get the content out man]
7. Don’t trust the automatic save feature? Well, now you can just press the save button in settings. Enjoy!
8. Exporting now automatically puts your code in a .txt file named SynergismSave. This file will be found in your download tab. Enjoy!

# New Content

## Challenge 8, kinda.
You can enter the eighth challenge to get a taste of the difficulty. However, the requirement is currently set to a value impossible by any legitimate player. This is just a teaser for what’s to come. Also new content teasers within the description of the challenge

## 5 New Researches FOR REAL!
If you have obtained the achievement for completing challenge seven, {[No Accelerator/Multiplier]}, five times, you will have unlocked five new researches! Each of the five researches is far more expensive than most anything you’ve saved up for previously [Resource sinks, amirite?], but each give powerful bonuses that you will absolutely want for the new content drop! From 2x obtainium everywhere to 2x rune exp to +250 rune levels, it’ll give a surge in wealth the likes which no one, not even Bezos himself, has seen!

**Special Code: 111111hype**

Thank you so much for making Synergism such a success. This game has so far exceeded all of my expectations in terms of being received by the community and I have to thank all of you for making Synergism such a fun thing for me to develop. It’s like my little baby now, in a sense.

Put in this code for a whopping 200 free quarks. With the shop coming in v1.009 these will be very valuable for you!
